# Define the list of nodes in order to setup most of the services.
#  cndeploy_node_management_ip:
#    set to the IPv4 address used by Ansible to connect to the node.
#    Usually the same than node_ip, but it can change when using a vpn or mng nets.
#    This address must be correctly defined so Ansible can resolve the other host vars.
#  cndeploy_node_ip: (required by this role)
#    set to the IPv4 address where the node services will be listening.
#    This address must be public in the case of relays.
#  cndeploy_node_port: (required by this role)
#    set to the TCP port number where the node must be listening.
#  cndeploy_node_hostname:
#    set to the desired hostname for the node.
#  cndeploy_node_cores:
#    set to the number of cores that the node software must use (<= of available)
#  cndeploy_node_type: (required by this role)
#    set to the type of node for that entry, allowed values are:
#    - bp, full bp setup. The one with a lower prio receives incoming pull
#        connections from relays, making it this way the one active.
#    - relay, full relay setup, a minimum of two is recommended for high availability.
#    - standby, generic node setup not participating in the stake pool with any role,
#        but being kept in sync so it can take any role after a restart when needed.
#  cndeploy_node_prio: (required by this role)
#    set the priority (1 to 99) for the node in his role type, mostly used for
#    bp active/passive selection.
#
# Required.
