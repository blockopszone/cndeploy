# cndeploy
cndeploy is a collection of scripts and configurations that provide automated ways of deploying Cardano nodes and staking pools following the best practices, with the ultimate goal of helping to achieve a secure and highly availability setup. 

This project is in alpha stage, code provided isn't thoroughly tested, and no documentation is available, so at the moment it is meant to be used only in develpment and test environments.
